          <p>
            Welcome to No Nasties, where fashion meets sustainability. We are India's oldest and most
            established vegan clothing brand, rewriting the rules of fashion to prove that style can
            also be a force for good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Founded on the principle that fashion should heal the planet, not harm it, we've created
            a brand that is 100% organic, fair trade, and carbon negative. Every garment is crafted
            with care using certified organic cotton and linen, sourced through fair trade practices
            from our all-Indian supply chain.
          </p>
          <p>
            From seed to garment, our process is designed to make a positive impact. We plant trees
            around the world, remove carbon from the atmosphere, and ensure that every step of our
            production supports both people and the planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Join us in our mission to heal the world through conscious fashion. Together, we can
            make the fashion industry a force for good.
